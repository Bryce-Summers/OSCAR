This is an example file that conveniently also contains my notes.


-- is the syntax for comments.

//http://learnyouahaskell.com/types-and-typeclasses
variable_name :: (TypeClass a) => type

Typeclasses are kind of like Java interfaces and indicate that the given types implement some standard functions.

Show is a type class that represents types that my be converted to strings with the 'show' function


fromIntegral converts integers to general numbers (or floating point's?)

Types are upper case, variables are lower case. This is mandated by the compiler and language specification.

Good stuff about types and typeclasses.
